Convenience functions for responses generated by this daemon in response to requests.

## Usage
```
import {
  response,
  response302,
  buildCookie
 } from 'webdaemon'
```

## Patterns
Return a response object from a handler function:
```typescript
return response({
  ok: 'Great work'
})
```

Return a 404 response from a handler function:
```typescript
return response({
  error: '404 Cannot find that thing you requested'a
})
```
Note that an integer at the start of an error attribute is used
in the response status code.
