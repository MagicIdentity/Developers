Provides methods for creating, validating and reading the security tokens used
in daemon applications for authentication and authorization.

## Usage
Each token is addressed to an audience `aud` who uses it for authentication and authorization:
```typescript
const party = token.getParty() // This will be you.
```

Each token is generated by a counterparty `sub`, whose public key is used to validate the signature:
```typescript
const counterparty = token.getSub() // Do you allow requests from this daemon or system?
```

Each token is generated by the counterparty from an HTML app `src`, identified by URL:
```typescript
const appUrl = token.getSourceUrl() // Do you allow requests from this page?
```

Each token requests capabilities on other HTML apps installed on the party, identified by URL:
```typescript
const sources = token.getSources()  // Does this include the URL of your app?
```

For each HTML source, the requested capabilities can be retrieved:
```typescript
const capabilities = token.getCapabilities(sourceUrl) // Does this include the capability you offer?
```
