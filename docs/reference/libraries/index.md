Various libraries help you develop Web Agent apps.

These are maintained under the prefix `https://webdaemon.online/<VERSION>/static/lib/`.

The version number we recommend at present is `dev`, unless you are putting a web
agent app into production. Each release of the Web Agent platform has a version number
such as `11.4` but this is not yet subject to a formal release process.

## Import Maps
We recommend the use of import maps to ensure consistent versioning across your apps.

- [Using Import Maps](importmaps) in browser and backend code.

## Libraries
Library documentation is auto-generated from the source code. Please contact
[support@magic-id.com](mailto:support@magic-id.com) if you find errors, inconsistencies
or would like clearer documentation in any area.

Note that browser-side code can only use Javascript libraries. Daemon-side code can use
both Javascript and Typescript libraries.
