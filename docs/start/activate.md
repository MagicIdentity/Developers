# Daemon Activation
Web agent servers (_web daemons_) are hosted by providers such as [Magic ID](https://magic-id.com).

Soon Magic will offer a self-serve activation flow which works like this:

1. Go to the activation site.
2. Enter your mobile number.
3. Click on the link to get to your web daemon.

That flow will also allow you to get back to your daemon should you lose access.

In the meantime, you can email [support@magic-id.com](mailto:support@magic-id.com) and we will
email you back an activation link.

# Agent Recovery
If you lose access to your daemon, the self-serve flow above will reclaim it for you.

In the meantime, just email [support@magic-id.com](mailto:support@magic-id.com) and we will
email you back a reclaim link.
