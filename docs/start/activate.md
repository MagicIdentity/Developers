# Agent Activation
Web agents are hosted by web agent providers such as [Magic ID](https://magic-id.com).

In December this year, Magic will offer a self-serve activation flow which works like this:

1. Go to the activation site.
2. Enter your mobile number.
3. Click on the link to get to your agent.

That flow will also allow you to get back to your agent should you lose access.

In the meantime, you can email [support@magic-id.com](mailto:support@magic-id.com) and we will
email you back an activation link.

# Agent Recovery
If you lose access to your agent, the self-serve flow above will reclaim it for you.

In the meantime, just email [support@magic-id.com](mailto:support@magic-id.com) and we will
email you back a reclaim link.
