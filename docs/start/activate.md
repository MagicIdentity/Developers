# Daemon Activation
Web agent servers (_web daemons_) are hosted by providers such as [Magic ID](https://magic-id.com).

Magic offers a self-serve activation flow:

1. Go to the [activation page](https://magic-id.com/provision)
2. Enter your mobile number.
3. Click on the link to get to your web daemon.

That flow will also allow you to get back to your daemon should you lose access.

# Agent Recovery
If you lose access to your daemon, the self-serve flow above will reclaim it for you.
