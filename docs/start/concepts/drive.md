Every web agent has a private drive. This is like Google Drive - only simpler because it provides a folder structure exactly like
the drive inside your Mac or PC.

Folders and files can be marked as _public_ or _private_ (the default). Thus, you can upload a directory from your
Mac or PC containing an app that you have developed and make it available for others to enjoy.
