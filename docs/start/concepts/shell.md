Each individual web agent is controlled by whomever owns it, using the Web Agent Shell.

The standard shell looks a bit like a smartphone home screen.

It lets you install, remove, share and launch apps.

You can also upload and download files and directories to the agent's private drive.

You can use the same shell on multiple devices. For example, your smartphone, laptop and office PC can all control the same agent.
