As a developer, you will need to control your web agent(s).

![Home Screen]({{ "/assets/images/phone.png" | relative_url }}){: .small.left}
You do this using the Web Agent Shell, which you will see on your browser when
you first activate your agent.

The standard shell looks a bit like a smartphone home screen. It lets you install, remove, share and launch apps.

You can also upload and download files and directories to the agent's private drive.

The shell lets you 'infect' other devices, so for example your smartphone, laptop and office PC can all control the same agent.

If you lose access to your shell, your provider can get you back in control.
