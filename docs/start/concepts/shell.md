As a developer, you will need to control your web daemon and the agents running on it.

![Home Screen]({{ "/assets/images/phone.png" | relative_url }}){: .small.left}
You do this using the web daemon shell, which you will see on your browser when
you first activate your web daemon.

The standard shell looks a bit like a smartphone home screen. It lets you install, remove, share and launch apps along
with their agents.

You can also upload and download files and directories to the web daemon's private drive.

The shell lets you 'infect' other devices, so for example your smartphone, laptop and office PC can all control the same daemon.

If you lose access to your shell, your provider can get you back in control.
