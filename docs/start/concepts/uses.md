Web agents can make anything directly addressable on the web. For example:

  - `jane.doe.family` is a personal agent unique to one person, able to interact with business systems, personal wallets, websites or other web agents. For
    example, this might provide automatic login so Jane can forget passwords, expose functionality in a government-issued identity wallet, provide a 2FA capability,
    allow Jane to play multiuser games and share selected personal data to appropriate businesses.
  - `gateway.acme.com` is a business agent providing a set of services such as gateways for identify verification,
    biometric authentication, Shopify apps and a Twilio gateway to handle outbound text messaging.
  - `s-44-a433100002.iot.neff.com` is an IoT agent paired with a smart domestic appliance, providing
    a set of endpoints for the manufacturer to collect data and provide updates; and for the consumer to manage the smart device.
