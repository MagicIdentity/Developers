Web Agents are designed to help with the integration
problems that arise when making systems work together.

Web Agents are:

- **Lightweight**
  - Frontend is standard web pages.
  - Backend provisioning is automatic.
  - Backend logic is written in Typescript (or Javascript)
- **Web Addressable**
  - Each web agent has a unique DNS hostname.
  - Each web agent is permanently available.
- **Dynamic**
  - Web Agents can be created and destroyed instantly.
  - App-specific API endpoints are installed and removed instantly.
  - Processes serving endpoints are started and stopped on demand.

Web Agents are instantly provisioned by Web Agent Providers, such as [Magic ID](https://magic-id.com).
