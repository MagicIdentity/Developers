Web agents give you new ways to design apps and deploy services. But you don't need
to learn new tech:

- **Familiar**
  - Use standard web tools such as HTML, CSS, JS, React and npm.
  - Use standard patterns such as REST using vanilla code or frameworks like Oak.
  - Use standard `npm` libraries in agent code subject to sandbox security.
- **Lightweight**
  - Agent provisioning and app deployment are instant and automatic.
  - Agent logic executes native Typescript or Javascript, optionally transpiled.
  - Agent Drive and Agent Storage provide lightweight persistence patterns.
- **Web Addressable**
  - Each web agent server (_web daemon_) has a unique hostname which is its identity.
  - Each web agent is available 24x7.
  - Agents can form peer-to-peer decentralized networks.
- **Dynamic**
  - Web agent servers (_web daemons_) can be created and destroyed instantly.
  - Web agents are installed and removed dynamically.
  - Your web agent logic is spun up on demand to serve a given endpoint.

Web agent servers (_web daemons_) are instantly provisioned for people, businesses and IoT devices
by web daemon providers, such as [Magic ID](https://magic-id.com).

You can also provision a web daemon in your own machine for development purposes.
