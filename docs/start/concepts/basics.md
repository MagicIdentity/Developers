Web agents give you new ways to design apps and deploy services. But you don't need
to learn new tech.

- **Familiar**
  - Use standard web tools such as HTML, CSS, JS and React.
  - Use standard web patterns such as REST and NodeJs servers.
- **Lightweight**
  - Agent provisioning and app deployment are instant and automatic.
  - Agent logic is written in Typescript (or Javascript)
- **Web Addressable**
  - Each web agent has a unique DNS hostname.
  - Each web agent is permanently available.
- **Dynamic**
  - Web agents can be created and destroyed instantly.
  - Web agent endpoints are installed and removed instantly.

Web Agents are instantly provisioned by Web Agent Providers, such as [Magic ID](https://magic-id.com).
