If you're new to Web Agents<sup>*</sup>, or need a quick refresher, we suggest
a quick read of these pages:

1. [Concepts]({{ "/start/concepts/" | relative_url }}) explains what Web Agents are for.
2. [Activate]({{ "/start/activate" | relative_url }}) explains how to activate (or reclaim) your own Web Agent.
3. [Shell]({{ "/start/shell" | relative_url }}) explains how the shell lets you manage your Web Agent.

<sup>*</sup>The internal name is actually _Web Daemon_, and you'll see this here and there. But the marketing folks prefer _Web Agent_ cos they're not aware of the ancient convention of long-running background processes being called daemons. Whatever.
