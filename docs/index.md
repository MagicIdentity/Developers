Welcome <party></party> to the Web Agent Developer Resources site.

The best place to start is probably [Starting Out](start). This
takes you through the basics including activating your own web agent server, or _web daemon_.

You can then move on to [Tutorials](tutorials). This shows how you can create and publish your
own app using React with a web agent backend.

You are welcome to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cMpHrDbk8b) where you will be able
to ask questions directly and see what other people are experiencing as the community grows.
