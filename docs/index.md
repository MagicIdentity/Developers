Welcome to the Web Agent Developer Resources site.

The best place to start is probably [Starting Out](start). This
takes you through the basics including activating your own web agent.

You can then move on to [Tutorials](tutorials) which explain how a simple Hello World app
hangs together, and then take you through building a React app that uses its own agent API.

You are welcome to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/cMpHrDbk8b) where you will be able
to ask questions directly and see what other people are experiencing as the community grows.
