Let's summarise what you've achieved:

1. You installed `deno` and `cloudflared`.
2. You created a standard React app template and placed it on a public URL.
3. You changed `App.jsx` to make an agent request on pressing the button.
4. You changed `index.html` to include the agent defined in `agent.yml`.
5. You created a simple agent server in `agent.js`.
6. You installed and launched the app from your web daemon shell.
