Let's summarise what you've achieved:

1. You installed `deno` and `cloudflared`.
2. You created a standard app template and put it on a public URL.
3. You changed `app.tsx` to make an agent request on pressing the button.
4. You defined the agent in `myapp.yml` and linked to it in `index.html`.
5. You created a simple agent server in `agent.js`.
6. You installed and ran the completed app from your web daemon shell.
